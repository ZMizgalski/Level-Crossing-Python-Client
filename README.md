## General Information
- This project was made for school competition and also to improve railroads in whole country. It uses AI to detect objects and decide to open crossing barriers when someone is blocked. To work properly it needs to be connected to a network. Client app is controlling servos connected to the Raspberry Pi

## Technologies Used
- OpenCv
- Socket
- Python
- Raspberry Pi
- Adafruit PCB

## Features
List the ready features here:
- Control of servos
- Socket connection

## Setup
- Python 3.6+
- configured pip
- More requirements found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ZMizgalski/Level-Crossing-Python-Client/blob/master/requirements.txt)

## Usage

IMPORTANT PARTS!
1. Raspberry Pi 4B at least https://www.raspberrypi.org/ and also multiple modifications
2. Raspberry Pi camera
3. Adafruit PCA9685 16-channel servo driver
4. Raspberry Pi power supply
5. 5V simple power supply (for PCA9685)
6. SD Card
7. 4 x 180 degree servo

DOWNLOADING CODE + [SERVER](https://github.com/ZMizgalski/Level-Crossing-Python-Server)
